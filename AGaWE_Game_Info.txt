Once you get an account setup with the server admin, you'll see a starfield, type /join to get a homeworld, defend it, love it. Only player homeworlds have a quailty of 10

You can now rename yourself something classy with /setempirename, or not. Whatever.

If you were smart enough to read this far before typing /join, you can place a number that corresponds with the following list to select your field of prefered research, else you get planetary defense. 
0 [RES_RESEARCH] = Improves the amount of RP you get from planets.
1 [RES_SHIPBUILDING] = Improves how fast you can build ships.
2 [RES_FLEETWEAPONS] = Improves how well your ships fight systems and other fleets.
3 [RES_FUELRANGE] = Extends the range your ships can fly from your worlds.
4 [RES_RADARRANGE] = Determines how far you can see other fleets and how close you have to be to see their strengths.
5 [RES_FLEETSPEED] = Dictates how fast your fleets can fly.
6 [RES_PLANETARYDEFENSE] = Improves how well your ships defend your systems.

HOW TO PLAY:

You can pan around using the left mouse button, just click and drag the screen around, zoom with the mouse wheel.

To move your fleets around, left click the planet you want to move them too, then right click the place you want to send them.

Make sure you check your research tab and change what you are researching now and again.
